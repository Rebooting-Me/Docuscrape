## Can Docuscrape only scrape documentations which has a 'Next' button for Navigation?

<img src="/hci.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
Yes, currently Docuscrape can only scrape documentations which has a 'Next' button for Navigation. I am working on adding support for other types of documentations as well.

## Will Docuscrape have support for other kinds of Documentations sites as well in future?

<img src="/support.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
In all probability, _**YES**_! Docuscrape is a personal project but if my time magament skills allow it, I will surely be adding more support in the near future!

## Why is Docuscrape only returning scraped markdown for the first page?

<img src="/why.png" decoding="async" loading="lazy"/>
Docuscrape's backend hosts a headles browser running Playwright script. Since this is a hobby project, I have hosted it on a free tier and the server shuts down after 48hrs of inactivity to save costs(_its a whole different struggle to host headless browsers on a free tier_). So this might have been the cause of the above anomaly. Refresh the page and run it again. Docuscrape should return all the scraped content properly this time!
